    Logging: Console.WriteLine is a rudimentary form of logging and might not be suitable for a real-world application. You might want to look into using a more powerful logging library, like Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, Serilog, NLog, etc.

    Error handling: You're correctly catching any exceptions that might occur during the HTTP request, but you might want to extend this to handle different types of exceptions in different ways. For instance, you could catch an HttpRequestException separately to handle issues with the HTTP request itself, and provide a more detailed error message.

    Unit Testing: Keep in mind the importance of testing your code. Methods such as the one you've written are prime candidates for unit testing, to ensure they behave as expected in various scenarios.

    Comments: Commenting is crucial for maintainability of your code. Always ensure your comments are meaningful and describe why something is done a certain way, not what is being done.

    Error propagation: You're currently re-throwing the exception after logging it. This is fine if you want the error to propagate up and potentially crash your application, but you might want to consider how you can handle errors more gracefully, especially in a user-facing application.
